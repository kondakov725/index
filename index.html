	<p><i>Welcome to a place which includes all you need to know about motorcycles.<br>
	There are too many kinds of motorcycles, different shapes, sizes and<br>
	power. Whenever you ride your bike, if it's on daily basis or once in a<br>
	week, I'm here to show you a little bit of my knowledge and maybe to<br>
	help you decide which bike is the best for you :)</i></p>
	
	<p><i>First of all, if you dont know, riding a motorcycle is very fun, but also<br>
	very dangerous, depends on the rider. As a biker myself, my most<br>
	important advice is to ride safely!</i></p>
	
	<p><i>As I told you, there are many types of motorcycles, each one of them<br>
	is special on it's own and will fulfil your needs differently.</i></p>
	
	<p><i>So let's begin with your first step of choosing the right bike for you!</i></p><br><br>
